Create a program that alculates the number of times the sum of the randomly rolled dice equals each possible value from 2 to 12.

Repeatedly asks the user for the number of times to roll the dice, quitting only when the user-entered number is less than 1. Hint: Use a while loop that will execute as long as num_rolls is greater than 1.

Prints a histogram in which the total number of times the dice rolls equals each possible value is displayed by printing a character, such as *, that number of times. The following provides an example:

Example Run:

Dice roll histogram:

2s:  **
3s:  ****
4s:  ***
5s:  ********
6s:  *************
7s:  *****************
8s:  *************
9s:  *********
10s: **********
11s: *****
12s: **
